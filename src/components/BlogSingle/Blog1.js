                        <p>A Non - Fungible Token or better known as NFT, is a unique one-of-a-kind cryptographic token on blockchain. Each token is different from the other and no two of them are the same. This is in contrast to a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin or XRP, where you can trade one Bitcoin for another one and you would essentially have the same cryptocurrency. Thus, cryptocurrencies are fungible tokens; One cannot do that with an NFT. If you try to trade one with the other, it would be impossible as every NFT has a different value and a unique digital signature that sets them apart. </p>

                            <p>NFTs don’t necessarily have to be images only; they can be videos, artwork, audio, a tweet, etc. Yes, that's right! Even a simple tweet can be tokenized and be sold as an NFT, just like the Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey did. He tokenized the first ever tweet where he said, “just setting up my twttr”, and sold it for close to <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://v.cent.co/tweet/20">$3 million.</a></p>

                        <p>If you are thinking, “well I can just take a screenshot of the tweet and do the same”, you would be wrong. Owning an NFT is like owning a copy of the Mona Lisa, where the original sits quaintly at The Louvre Museum. An NFT allows only an individual to own the original asset that is tokenized. “But how do you distinguish between a copy from an original?”, you ask. An NFT includes an authentication which is a proof of the ownership; This serves as one of the reasons why we see some NFTs selling for millions of dollars. They are a one-of-a-kind asset that cannot be replicated, thus making the supply limited, leading the price of the NFT to skyrocket.</p>
                        <p>Other types of common NFT assets are virtual avatars, collectibles, music and videos––more specifically sports highlights videos. A prime example is <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://nbatopshot.com/?utm_source=dapperlabs">NBA Top Shot.</a> The NBA has partnered with <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.dapperlabs.com/">Dapper labs</a>, famous for their CryptoKitties game, to mint a collection of digital assets. As of February, of this year, they have collected over <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/28/230-million-dollars-spent-on-nba-top-shot.html">$230 million</a> in sales to date. These sports NFTs are comparable to the trading cards that were collected back in the day. They were very scarce items back then, each one different from the other. </p>
                        <p>NFTs are not a recent invention, they have been around since 2014. It has only in the past few years that they have gained momentum as an efficient manner in which artists can sell their artwork digitally. Artists don’t have to go through the hassle of exhibiting their work in a gallery, instead they can cut out the middleman through an NFT platform and reach their audience directly. Additionally, since these are global platforms, artists are not restricted to a local audience; People from all over the globe are able to bid and purchase their favorite artists’ artwork. Another amazing feature that’s incorporated into the NFT is a commission that gets paid to the artist </p>
                        <img alt="" src="../img/blog1/image2.png"/>
                        <p>every time the NFT gets resold. Through this strategy, if initially they sold it at a very low cost but later in a few years it gains popularity, the artist can benefit from it and earn through that commission as it gets resold.</p>
                        <p>The most expensive NFT to be ever sold to date is <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://onlineonly.christies.com/s/beeple-first-5000-days/beeple-b-1981-1/112924">EVERYDAYS: THE FIRST 5000 DAYS.</a> This collage consisting of 5,000 artworks by Michael Joseph Winkelmann, popularly known as Beeple, sold for $69.3 million in early March of this year. He is an American digital artist known for creating bizarre images by morphing pop culture, technology and political satire. Initially using a pseudonym, Metakovan, the buyer revealed his identity a week later; Vignesh Sundaresan was the buyer of the most expensive NFT to date.</p>

                            <p>He upped his bid by $250,000 in the last few closing seconds and won the collage that depicted Beeple’s journey as an artist over the years. When he revealed his identity, he said that the purchase was a tribute to his brethren. In an <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://decrypt.co/62019/anonymous-buyer-of-69-million-beeple-nft-has-been-unmasked">interview with decrypt</a>, he said “The point was to show Indians and people of color that they, too, could be patrons, that crypto was an equalizing power between the West and the Rest, and that the global south was rising.” Upping the bid at the last second is a tactic Sundaresan has used before. Another <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://niftygateway.com/itemdetail/primary/0x6e5dc5405baefb8c0166bcc78d2692777f2cbffb/21">collection of Beeple’s artwork</a> was being auctioned at Nifty Gateway and at the very last second, he upped his bid from $380,000 to a whopping $777,777.</p>

                        <p>Next in line for the most expensive NFT sold is a CryptoPunk. If you are imagining a punk sold on the cryptographic world of blockchain then you are imagining right. <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks">Larva Labs</a>––the creators of CryptoPunks––minted 10,000 unique characters that were inspired by the modern CryptoArt movement. It is not the entire collection that was sold but an individual punk that sold for <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.sothebys.com/en/buy/auction/2021/natively-digital-cryptopunk-7523?showDetails&locale=en">$11.8 million</a>, more specifically CryptoPunk #7523. This particular punk is named as the Covid Alien that dons a surgical cap and a mask. CryptoPunk became so famous that they hold the third and fourth position of most expensive NFTs, each being sold for <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="http://f.com/most-expensive-nfts-why-they-cost-so-much/">$7.58 million and $7.57 million respectively.</a> </p>
                        <p>There are numerous platforms, or I should rather say digital marketplaces where one can buy NFTs. Some of the more popular ones are <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://opensea.io/">OpenSea.io</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://niftygateway.com/">NiftyGateway</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://rarible.com/">Rarible</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://foundation.app/">Foundation</a>, but among this mix there are the more traditional auction houses like Christie’s and Sotheby’s that have entered the market as well. These marketplaces represent the traditional way of bidding for art pieces within a particular time frame and then the highest bidder wins the collectible. But there is another way to acquire an NFT. Cryptocurrency holders can now acquire NFTs via an Airdrop or some other kind of a giveaway. The developers or creators of the cryptocurrency usually attach certain terms and conditions that need to be met in order to be eligible for the same. The most recent and exciting NFT giveaway that is taking place is the AMC theatre and Sony Pictures collaboration for their new movie: Spider Man - No Way Home. This is a first-of-its-kind movie promotion that is taking place all over the United States and those who qualify will be awarded with a unique NFT from a pool of a hundred specially designed NFTs.</p>
