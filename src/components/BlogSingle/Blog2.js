                        <p>My Spidey senses feel like something huge is happening: A collaboration that we have never seen before is going to take place and raise the standards for movie promotions worldwide! Cinema chain AMC Theatres, the world’s largest movie theatre chain from Kansas, announced that for the first time ever, members of its loyalty program who order advance tickets for the December 16th release of “Spider-Man: No Way Home “, will be gifted with non-fungible tokens (NFTs). These members include the AMC Stubs Premiere, AMC Stubs A-List and AMC Investor Connect. Those that are eligible will have an opportunity to receive a unique NFT from as many as 86,000 NFTs which will be available for this one-of-a-kind Sony and AMC celebration of the release of the movie.</p>

                        <p>For the uninitiated, an NFT is a Blockchain-based tokenization of a collectible item or an art piece. It is not restricted to static photos but also includes videos and highlight reels of some iconic moments in sports or entertainment industry. Through its unique digital signature that is embedded in the blockchain it is transparent for everyone to see the ‘owner of the token’ and this is the prime reason why it is named as a non-fungible token. It’s like someone other than Thor is trying to use Mjollnir: it is impossible, no one else is worthy! </p>

                        <p>AMC Theatres stated in a press release that more than one hundred NFT designs will be up for grabs and each of them are specially designed by powerhouse animation studio, Cub Studios, who have been previously bestowed with the British Academy Film Awards (BAFTA) and Lovie awards for their stellar work.</p>
                        <p>Like any other NFT giveaway, this one too comes with certain terms and conditions in order to be eligible for the same: The NFT giveaway will be valid only for tickets purchased or reserved for the opening day showtimes i.e. on December 16th, in all formats at all AMC theaters in the United States, while supplies last. It also requires that ticket holders be members of the AMC theaters loyalty program and the tickets be purchased on AMCTheatres.com or on the AMC mobile app. Those members must have their AMC Stubs account number associated with the transaction, and the movie ticket must be scanned at the theatre when the hodler arrives for the movie. If the ticket purchase is refunded or the ticket goes unused, or is not scanned, the NFT code will not be delivered. Thus, it makes it imperative that you go and watch the movie. </p>
                        <p>The Spider-Man NFT will be available to be redeemed at a dedicated site operated by WAX from December 22nd onwards up until March 1st; WAX is an energy efficient, ultra-low carbon footprint blockchain network.</p>
                        <p>And this is not the first blockchain integration that AMC theatres has done. Back in October of this year, they started accepting Dogecoin as a means of payment to purchase tickets and gift cards via BitPay, a Bitcoin payment service provider. In a tweet uploaded by the CEO Adam Aron, they are also accepting payments in Bitcoin and other Alternate Coins from September of this year. </p>
