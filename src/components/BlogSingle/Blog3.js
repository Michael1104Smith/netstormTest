                        <p>This month’s most bizarre NFT sale had to be the expensive NFT yacht called the “Metaflower Super Mega Yacht” that was designed by Republic Realm as part of its <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/fantasy-islands-sandbox">Fantasy Collection.</a> Republic Realm is a metaverse and NFT innovation and investment platform, that also has private islands, speed boats as well as jet skis as part of this collection. The NFT was part of the Sandbox virtual gaming world, where the yacht was sold for a whopping $650,000 (equivalent to 149 Ether tokens at the time) giving its buyer two helipads, hot tubs, and a DJ booth among other lavish facilities. It is estimated that with this sale that the Metaflower becomes the most expensive NFT to have been sold in the Sandbox metaverse. </p>

                        <p>Just a week back, someone paid close to $2.5 million for a digital plot of land on Decentraland, another metaverse like Sandbox, that allows its users to gather digital collectibles, build their own games, and monetise their experiences. We believe the metaverse craze began with this classic movie that gives its audience a taste of it, “Ready Player One.” Written around the central theme of the metaverse, the movie depicts perfectly how the players buy pieces of land, estates, and wearables for their virtual avatars to customise their experience of existing in an alternate reality. But in our reality, all the buyable items are NFTs — digital collectibles with actual monetary value.</p>
                        <p>Let’s take a deeper look at how a metaverse and NFT coexist and function. Oxford Dictionary defines metaverse as a virtual-reality space in which users can interact with a computer-generated environment and other users, whereas if you ask Mark Zuckerberg he will say, “it is the next chapter of the internet.” That is certainly true because if you look at the possibilities that this opens, it could change the way we do business, the way we socialize and play online, etc.; It is going to be the most pivotal part of the Web3 generation. On the other hand, a NFT is a digital asset made on a blockchain with a signature unique to the holder. For example, if you are a graphic designer, you can design a house, an armour or avatar skin, which would be completely unique AKA an NFT. You can go ahead and mint that on platforms like Decentraland, where the players can bid for these one-of-a-kind pieces and seamlessly become their new owners. </p>

                            <p>People from the finance industry as well have taken advantage of this mechanism and have designed a new way to create value. Take Sam Peurifoy for instance: A 27-year-old who left his job at Goldman Sachs to create wealth in the leading GameFi platform, Axie Infinity. His primary function has not changed though, he still acts like a banker in this reality, where he lends his NFTs to new players who cannot afford it allowing them to start playing the game. Later when these players win, they split the winnings with him, giving him rewards without having to master the game. This ingenious design has given him the right to be called Das Kapitalist online. In an interview with Insider, he mentioned that if he converted this money to legal tender, his annual income from this source would exceed his salary and bonus. </p>

                        <p>A lot of big tech companies have been cognizant about this shift in technology and have started to adapt their business model to it. The most recent and popular example would be Meta, formerly known as Facebook. Earlier this month, the company rebranded and are now calling themselves Meta, signalling their entry into the metaverse. Their recent acquisition of Oculus VR, makes them completely ready for this transition.  Sony has also invested big bucks in creating their own metaverse. Epic Games, the creators of Fortnite, have taken over the reign for this. Another great use case that we found is the Omniverse platform created by Nvidia Corp. It is mainly a reality for engineers, where they can create simulations of the physical building and factories. </p>
