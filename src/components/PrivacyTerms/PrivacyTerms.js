                                    <h4>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT FROM OUR USERS?</h4>
                                    <p>The information we collect from you falls into two categories: (i) personally identifiable information (i.e., data that could potentially identify you as an individual) (“Personal Information”), and (ii) non-personally identifiable information (i.e., information that cannot be used to identify who you are) (“Non-Personal Information”). This Privacy Policy covers both categories and will tell you how we might collect and use each type. We do our best not to collect any Personal Information from SpaceGrime users. That being said, when using our Services, we do collect PUBLIC wallet addresses that you generate through your wallet. Further, we may collect some Personal Information from you when you communicate with us, including your contact information, such as your phone number, social media handle, or email address (depending on how you reach out). Like other online services, we also collect a variety of Non-Personal Information, including: Information you create through the SpaceGrime’s NFT Marketplace’s website or decentralized applications, including public wallet addresses.

                                    <p>You can request access to the information we have collected from you. You can do this by contacting us at management@spacegrime.com. We will make sure to provide you with a copy of the data we process about you. To comply with your request, we may ask you to verify your identity. We will fulfill your request by sending your copy electronically. For any subsequent access request, we may charge you with an administrative fee. If you believe that the information we have collected is incorrect, you are welcome to contact us so we can update it and keep your data accurate. Any data that is no longer needed for purposes specified in the “How We Use the Information We Gather” section will be deleted after ninety (90) days. Wallet addresses created through the SpaceGrime’s NFT Marketplace’s application cannot be deleted from the Binance blockchain, therefore we are unable to delete this personal information. If at any point you wish for SpaceGrime to delete information about you, you may contact us at management@spacegrime.com.</p>

                                    <h4>DATA RETENTION</h4>
                                    <p>We are committed to making sure your information is protected and have selected third-party vendors which use the Binance network, including Trust Wallet and Metamask, that help keep your Personal Information safe. Unfortunately, we do not control these third parties and therefore cannot guarantee complete security. We employ several physical and electronic safeguards to keep your information safe, including encrypted user passwords, two factor verification and authentication on passwords where possible, and securing all connections with industry standard transport layer security. Even with all these precautions, we cannot fully guarantee against the access, disclosure, alteration, or deletion of data through events, including but not limited to hardware or software failure or unauthorized use. Any information that you provide to us is done so entirely at your own risk.</p>

                                    <p>We are especially sensitive about children’s information. Our Services are not targeted towards children, and we don’t knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13. If you are a parent or legal guardian of a minor child, we will treat any information that you provide us while using SpaceGrime’s NFT Marketplace on behalf of your minor child as Personal Information as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy.

                                    <h4>ONLINE TRACKING AND HOW WE RESPOND TO DO NOT TRACK SIGNALS</h4>
                                    <p>Online tracking is the collection of data about an individual’s Internet activity used to deliver targeted advertisements and for other purposes. Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome) incorporate a “Do Not Track” (DNT) or similar feature that signals to websites that a visitor does not want to have his/her online activity and behavior tracked. If an online service elects to respond to a particular DNT signal, the service may refrain from collecting certain personal information about the browser’s user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and there is currently no industry consensus as to what constitutes a DNT signal. For these reasons, many website operators, including SpaceGrime, do not take action to respond to DNT signals. For more information about DNT signals, visit http://allaboutdnt.com.</p>

We occasionally review this Privacy Policy to make sure it complies with applicable laws and conforms to changes in our business. We may need to update this Privacy Policy, and we reserve the right to do so at any time. If we do revise this Privacy Policy, we will update the “Effective Date” at the bottom of this page so that you can tell if it has changed since your last visit and will do our best to notify you. Please review this Privacy Policy regularly to ensure that you are aware of its terms.

                                        <h5>1. CERTAIN DEFINED TERMS AND RELATED INFORMATION</h5>
                                            <h6>1.1 NFTs and Collectibles.</h6>
                                                <p>(a) “NFTs” mean Binance Smart Chain-based tokens complying with the ERC-721 standard, ERC-1155 standard or other similar “non-fungible” token standard. NFTs are intended to be “non-fungible” tokens representing a unique Collectible; however, certain NFTs may be fungible with one another (i.e., all such NFTs are associated with the same Collectible Metadata) while being non-fungible with other NFTs (i.e., such NFTs are associated with different Collectible Metadata).</p>
                                                <p>(b) Collectibles (i) “Collectible” means the association on Binance Smart Chain of an NFT with a Uniform Resource Identifier (“URI”) identifying an appropriately configured JSON file conforming to the ERC-721 Metadata JSON Schema, ERC-1155 Metadata URI JSON Schema or a similar JSON schema, as applicable (such JSON file, the “Collectible ID”).</p>
                                                <p>2 (ii) The Collectible ID of a Collectible specifies the properties of the Collectible, including the name and description of the Collectible (the “Collectible Descriptors”), a URI identifying any image file associated with the Collectible (the “Collectible Image”) and potentially other “metadata” associated with the Collectible (the Collectible Descriptors, Collectible Image and such other metadata, collectively, the “Collectible Metadata”). The Collectible Metadata for Collectibles created through the SpaceGrime Applications are typically stored on IPFS through an IPFS node operated by SpaceGrime. The Collectible Metadata for Collectibles created outside the SpaceGrime Applications may be stored in other ways, depending on how such Collectibles were created.</p>
                                                <p>(iii) There can be no guarantee or assurance of the uniqueness, originality or quality of any Collectible or Collectible Metadata. In the absence of an express legal agreement between the creator of a Collectible and purchasers of the Collectible, there cannot be any guarantee or assurance that the purchase or holding of the Collectible confers any license to or ownership of the Collectible Metadata or other intellectual property associated with the Collectible or any other right or entitlement, notwithstanding that User may rightfully own or possess the NFT associated with the Collectible.</p>
                                                <p>(iv) SpaceGrime may from time to time remove certain Collectibles from the SpaceGrime Apps or restrict the creation of Collectibles on the SpaceGrime Apps in SpaceGrime’s sole and absolute discretion, including in connection with any belief by SpaceGrime that such Collectible violates these Terms or the terms and conditions or privacy policy of the SpaceGrime Apps. SpaceGrime does not commit and shall not be liable for any failure to support, display or offer or continue to support, display or offer any Collectible for trading through the SpaceGrime Apps.</p>
                                            <h6>1.2 Offerings.</h6>
                                                <p>(a) “Offerings” means the SpaceGrime Platform and all uses thereof, the SpaceGrime Apps, the SpaceGrime DEX System, GRIMEX, the SpaceGrime DAO and the SpaceGrime Governance Module. </p>
                                                <p>(b) “GRIMEX” means the tokens with string constant public name “SpaceGrime” and string constant public symbol “GRIMEX”, the supply and balances of which are tracked by the smart contract deployed to address [INSERT WALLET ADDRESS HERE] on Binance Smart Chain. Each GRIMEX entitles the holder to one vote per proposal in the SpaceGrime DAO.</p>
                                                <p>(c) “SpaceGrime Apps” means the consumer software applications created, operated and made publicly available by SpaceGrime for transactions involving Collectibles and the SpaceGrime DEX System, other than the SpaceGrime DEX System itself. On the date these Terms were first published, the SpaceGrime Apps consisted of the world wide web application hosted at https://SpaceGrime.com/ (the “SpaceGrime Website”).

                                            <h6>3.1 Nature of SpaceGrime DEX System.</h6>
                                                <p>The SpaceGrime DEX System is a public software utility deployed on Binance Smart Chain, which is accessible directly through any Binance Smart Chain node or indirectly through any compatible Binance Smart Chain “wallet” application which interacts with such a node. Through the SpaceGrime DEX System, any person may create, buy, sell and transfer Collectibles.</p>
                                            <h6>3.2 Relationship of SpaceGrime DEX System and SpaceGrime Apps.</h6>
                                                <p>Interacting with the SpaceGrime DEX System does not require use of the SpaceGrime Apps, but the SpaceGrime Apps provide a potentially more convenient and user-friendly method of reading and displaying data (including Collectible Metadata) from the SpaceGrime DEX System and generating standard transaction messages compatible with the SpaceGrime DEX System. Interacting with the SpaceGrime DEX System through the SpaceGrime Apps requires use of an independent, User-operated Binance Smart Chain wallet application through which the user may broadcast the transaction message to Binance Smart Chain for processing by Binance Smart Chain nodes. The SpaceGrime Apps may be used to generate standard transaction messages for interacting with the SpaceGrime DEX System and transmitting those messages to the wallet application. Through the wallet application, a User may broadcast the transaction message to Binance Smart Chain for processing by Binance Smart Chain nodes. Assuming normal operation of the wallet and the relevant Binance Smart Chain nodes, the Binance Smart Chain nodes should utilize such transaction messages to make function calls against the relevant bytecode and ultimately include the results of such computations in an Binance Smart Chain transaction block, thus effectuating an interaction with the SpaceGrime DEX System.</p>
                                            <h6>3.3 License to Use the SpaceGrime Platform.</h6>
                                                <p>Each User, subject to and conditioned upon such User’s acceptance of and adherence to these Terms, is hereby granted a non transferable, personal, non-sublicensable license to use the SpaceGrime DEX System and SpaceGrime Apps for their intended purposes.</p>
                                            <h6>3.4 Alterations to SpaceGrime DEX System.</h6>
                                                <p>SpaceGrime may from time to time alter the list of smart contracts which are included in the SpaceGrime DEX System by adding or removing bytecode addresses from the official list of smart contracts supported by the SpaceGrime Apps, including pursuant to upgrades, forks, security incident responses or chain migrations. In the event any bytecode is removed from the SpaceGrime DEX System, users would no longer be able to interact with or read the data that is associated with such bytecode through the SpaceGrime Apps. It is intended (though cannot be guaranteed) that Users would continue to be able to interact with such bytecode directly through any Binance Smart Chain node or indirectly through any compatible Binance Smart Chain wallet application, but such interactions may require technical expertise beyond those of most Users.</p>
                                            <h6>3.5 Content.</h6>

                                                <p>The SpaceGrime DAO was established by SpaceGrime to foster community among the artists, collectors, traders and other users of the SpaceGrime Platform (the “SpaceGrime Community”) and provide them with a voice in how the SpaceGrime Platform is run, maintained, marketed, improved and otherwise governed (“Governance Decisions”).</p>
                                            <h6>6.2 Purposes of GRIMEX.</h6>
                                                <p>GRIMEX are intended to be utilized by the SpaceGrime Community to participate in the SpaceGrime DAO, including by voting on proposed Governance Decisions (“Governance Proposals”). GRIMEX may from time to time be given additional uses as determined by SpaceGrime (in non-binding consultation with the SpaceGrime DAO) (during the Signaling Era (as defined below)) or by the SpaceGrime DAO alone (during the Autonomous Era (as defined below)).</p>
                                            <h6>6.3 Evolution of SpaceGrime DAO.</h6>
                                                <p>The SpaceGrime DAO is intended to increase its autonomy and responsibility for influencing Governance Decisions over time. The anticipated evolution of the SpaceGrime DAO will be divided into two main periods or ‘eras’:</p>
                                                <h7>(a) Signaling Era.</h7>
                                                    <p>The “Signaling Era” began on the date GRIMEX were first distributed to the SpaceGrime Community and currently remains ongoing. During the Signaling Era, SpaceGrime will retain ultimate operational and governance authority over the SpaceGrime Platform while consulting in its discretion with the SpaceGrime DAO regarding potential Governance Decisions (expressed as Governance Proposals made by SpaceGrime to the SpaceGrime DAO) expected to have a material direct impact on the interests of the SpaceGrime Community. During the Signaling Era, the actions and determinations of the SpaceGrime DAO will be treated as non-binding, advisory signals to SpaceGrime regarding the will and interests of the SpaceGrime Community, but will not be obligated to support or comply with the actions and determinations of the SpaceGrime DAO. Nevertheless, SpaceGrime currently anticipates abiding by the SpaceGrime DAO’s majority-supported determinations regarding Governance Proposals that are made by SpaceGrime during the Signaling Era, provided that the resulting Governance Decisions would not reasonably be expected to result in a violation of applicable legal requirement or have a material adverse impact on the SpaceGrime Platform or SpaceGrime. During the Signaling Era, GRIMEX holders may also initiate their own Governance Proposals (i.e., independent of SpaceGrime) to the SpaceGrime DAO. SpaceGrime will in good faith consider the merits of any such Governance Proposal that receives majority support of the SpaceGrime DAO during the Signaling Era, but SpaceGrime cannot currently anticipate the likelihood that SpaceGrime will choose to support or give effect to such independent Governance Proposals. </p>
                                                <h7>(b) Autonomous Era.</h7>
                                                    <p>During the “Autonomous Era,” to the maximum extent reasonably practicable, except as may be limited by applicable legal requirements, the SpaceGrime DAO will have exclusive ultimate authority to make Governance Decisions, including the determination of the smart contracts utilized in the SpaceGrime DEX System, the amount and types of fees to be charged to users of the SpaceGrime Platform and the use of such fees for funding the operation and maintenance by SpaceGrime of the SpaceGrime Apps or the operation and maintenance by other entities or persons of alternative applications for interacting with the SpaceGrime DEX System. The transition to the Autonomous Era will occur at a time to be determined in the sole discretion of SpaceGrime, subject to confirmation by the SpaceGrime DAO that it is prepared to assume all responsibility for future Governance Decisions. SpaceGrime’s plan for transitioning to the Autonomous Era currently remains under active research and development, but SpaceGrime currently anticipates that at least the following technologies, measures, conditions and agreements must be initialized and tested before the Autonomous Era can begin:</p>
                                                    <p>(i) broad distribution of GRIMEX among a diverse cross-section of members of the SpaceGrime Community;</p>
                                                    <p>(ii) the establishment and publication of legally binding SpaceGrime DAO Bylaws setting forth the principles, rules, procedures, standards of conduct and other relevant agreements and understandings determining the rights and obligations of GRIMEX holders, the voting of GRIMEX and the operation, coordination and decision-making of the SpaceGrime DAO;</p>
                                                    <p>(iii) the completion of an initial compliance plan for abiding by tax laws and other laws, rules and regulations applicable to the SpaceGrime DAO;</p>
                                                    <p>(iv) upgrading the SpaceGrime Governance Module to include a system of SpaceGrime DAO Smart Contracts facilitating trust-reduced compliance with the SpaceGrime DAO Bylaws and escrowing of fees generated by the SpaceGrime DEX System; and</p>
                                                    <p>(v) the negotiation and signing of written commercial agreements between the SpaceGrime DAO, on the one hand, and SpaceGrime and/or other technology companies, on the other hand, through which the SpaceGrime DAO can provide funding and direction to such companies for the development, maintenance and operation of the SpaceGrime Apps, the licensing of relevant intellectual property such as branding-related trade dress and logos currently owned by SpaceGrime, and/or other applications and infrastructure necessary or useful for interacting with the SpaceGrime DEX System.</p>
                                                <h7>(c) Current SpaceGrime Governance Module.</h7>
                                                    <p>As of the date of publication of these Terms, the SpaceGrime Governance Module is configured as follows:</p>
                                                    <p>(i) potential Governance Proposals that may be of interest to the SpaceGrime DAO are typically first discussed and refined on https://SpaceGrime.com;</p>
                                                    <p>(ii) when ready to be formally considered by the SpaceGrime DAO, a Governance Proposal is entered and made available for voting on SpaceGrime’s Telegram community (https://t.me/spacegrimechat);</p>
                                                    <p>(iii) during the voting period (typically seven days), eligible GRIMEX holders may vote their eligible GRIMEX on the Governance Proposal through https://t.me/spacegrimechat, with each whole eligible GRIMEX entitling the holder to a single vote on each Governance Proposal (and each fractional eligible GRIMEX entitling the holder to a corresponding fractional vote);</p>
                                                    <p>(iv) eligibility of GRIMEX to vote on each Governance Proposal is based on a “snapshot” of GRIMEX account balances on Binance Smart Chain at a specific block of the Binance Smart Chain blockchain prior to commencement of the voting period for such Governance Proposal; </p>
                                                    <p>(v) the official determination of the SpaceGrime DAO on the Governance Proposal will be the determination supported by a simple majority of the GRIMEX that were actually voted on such Governance Proposal;</p>
                                                    <p>(vi) there is no quorum (minimum number of GRIMEX voting) required for the SpaceGrime DAO to make a determination on a Governance Proposal; and</p>
                                                    <p>(vii) voters are only pseudonymously identifiable by Binance Smart Chain address; accordingly, there is no reasonably practicable method of verifying the identities or interests of voters and there are no express rules regarding recusal of voters or disqualification of votes based on conflicts of interest or other similar factors; however, SpaceGrime may take any evidence of conflicts of interest or other issues regarding specific voters that comes to the attention of SpaceGrime into account in determining whether and how to implement determinations of the SpaceGrime DAO in Governance Decisions.</p>

                                                    <p>(ii) 10% of the TotalSupply (the “AirdropSupply”) will be allocated to bona fide active users the of SpaceGrime Apps (based on their trading volume prior to announcement of GRIMEX) and holders of Collectibles eligible to trade on the SpaceGrime Apps that were previously involved in sales documented on Dune Analytics; and will be allocated to users who engage in bona fide, good faith, arm’s-length trading of Collectibles on the SpaceGrime Apps, based on the transaction value of such trading. </p>
                                                <h7>(b) All questions concerning the interpretation and implementation of such allocation principles and the eligibility of a given person to receive GRIMEX or the specific amount of GRIMEX to be received by an eligible person out of the ReserveSupply, AirdropSupply, MiningSupply or otherwise, as applicable, shall be determined: </h7>

                                                <p>(a), and without limiting the generality of Section 7.2</p>
                                                <p>(b), SpaceGrime shall not be required or obligated to distribute any GRIMEX (out of the AirDropSupply, MiningSupply, or otherwise) to, or honor the voting or other rights of GRIMEX held by, any person who, as determined in the sole and absolute discretion of SpaceGrime, directly or indirectly, in connection with the use of the SpaceGrime Platform, SpaceGrime Apps, SpaceGrime DEX System, SpaceGrime DAO, GRIMEX or any transactions involving NFTs or Collectibles, has violated these Terms, including any use of the Offerings set forth in Section 5.2.

                                                <p>SpaceGrime utilizes experimental cryptographic technologies and blockchain technologies, including tokens, cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, “smart contracts,” consensus algorithms, voting systems and distributed, decentralized or peer-to-peer networks or systems in performing the Offerings. Each User acknowledges and agrees that such technologies are novel, experimental, and speculative, and that therefore there is significant uncertainty regarding the operation and effects and risks thereof and the application of existing law thereto.</p>
                                                <h7>(b) Certain Risks of Blockchain Technology.</h7>
                                                <p>The technology utilized in delivering the Offerings depends on public peer-to-peer networks such as Binance Smart Chain that are not under the control or influence of SpaceGrime and are subject to many risks and uncertainties. Such technologies include the SpaceGrime DEX System, which SpaceGrime may have limited or no ability to change, other than ceasing to support certain “smart contracts” and adding support for new “smart contracts”. Users are solely responsible for the safekeeping of the private key associated with the blockchain address used to participate in the Offerings. SpaceGrime will not be able to restore or issue any refund in respect of any Collectibles or GRIMEX due to lost private keys. If a User is not able to spend or use a Collectible or GRIMEX due to loss or theft of the corresponding private key or otherwise, a User will be unable to exercise their rights with respect to such Collectible or GRIMEX.</p>
                                                <h7>(c) Certain Risks of Smart Contract Technology.</h7>
                                                <p>Collectibles, GRIMEX and other digital assets relevant to the SpaceGrime Platform depend on the SpaceGrime DEX System or other smart contracts deployed to Binance Smart Chain, some of which may be coded or deployed by persons other than SpaceGrime. Once deployed to Binance Smart Chain, the code of smart contracts, including the SpaceGrime DEX System, cannot be modified. In the event that the SpaceGrime DEX System or other smart contracts are adversely affected by malfunctions, bugs, defects, malfunctions, hacking, theft, attacks, negligent coding or design choices, or changes to the protocol rules of Binance Smart Chain, Users may be exposed to a risk of total loss and forfeiture of all Collectibles, GRIMEX and other relevant digital assets. SpaceGrime assumes no liability or responsibility for any of the foregoing matters, except as otherwise expressly provided by these Terms or required by applicable law. </p>
                                                <h7>(d) Asset Prices.</h7>
                                                <p>The fiat-denominated prices and value in public markets of assets such as BNB, NFTs, Collectibles and GRIMEX have historically been subject to dramatic fluctuations and are highly volatile. As relatively new products and technologies, blockchain-based assets are not widely accepted as a means of payment for goods and services. A significant portion of demand for these assets is generated by speculators and investors seeking to profit from the short- or long-term holding of blockchain assets. The market value of any BNB, NFT, Collectible or GRIMEX may decline below the price for which a User acquires such asset through the SpaceGrime Platform or on any other platform. User acknowledges and agrees that the costs and speeds of transacting with cryptographic and blockchain-based systems such as Binance Smart Chain are variable and may increase or decrease dramatically at any time, resulting in prolonged inability to access or use any BNB, NFTs, Collectibles, GRIMEX or other digital assets associated with the SpaceGrime Platform.</p>
                                                <h7>(e) Regulatory Uncertainty.</h7>
                                                <p>Blockchain technologies and digital assets are subject to many legal and regulatory uncertainties, and the SpaceGrime Platform, NFTs, Collectibles and GRIMEX could be adversely impacted by one or more regulatory or legal inquiries, actions, suits, investigations, claims, fines or judgments, which could impede or limit the ability of User to continue the use and enjoyment of such assets and technologies.</p>
                                                <h7>(f) Cryptography Risks.</h7>
                                                <p>Cryptography is a progressing field. Advances in code cracking or technical advances such as the development of quantum computers may present risks to Binance Smart Chain, the SpaceGrime Platform, NFTs, Collectibles and GRIMEX, including the theft, loss or inaccessibility thereof.</p>
                                                <h7>(g) Fork Handling.</h7>
                                                <p>Binance Smart Chain, the SpaceGrime DEX System, the NFTs, the Collectibles and GRIMEX may be subject to “forks.” Forks occur when some or all persons running the software clients for a particular blockchain system adopt a new client or a new version of an existing client that:</p>
                                                <p>(i) changes the protocol rules in backwards-compatible or backwards-incompatible manner that affects which transactions can be added into later blocks, how later blocks are added to the blockchain, or other matters relating to the future operation of the protocol; or</p>
                                                <p>(ii) reorganizes or changes past blocks to alter the history of the blockchain. Some forks are “contentious” and thus may result in two or more persistent alternative versions of the protocol or blockchain, either of which may be viewed as or claimed to be the legitimate or genuine continuation of the original. SpaceGrime may not be able to anticipate, control or influence the occurrence or outcome of forks, and does not assume any risk, liability or obligation in connection therewith. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, SpaceGrime does not assume any responsibility to notify a User of pending, threatened or completed forks. SpaceGrime will respond to any forks as SpaceGrime determines in its sole and absolute discretion, and SpaceGrime shall not have any duty or obligation or liability to a User if such response (or lack of such response) acts to a User detriment. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, SpaceGrime’s possible and permissible responses to a fork may include:</p>
                                                <p>(i) honoring the SpaceGrime DEX System, Collectibles, NFTs and GRIMEX on both chains;</p>
                                                <p>(ii) honoring the SpaceGrime DEX System, Collectibles, NFTs and GRIMEX on only one of the chains;</p>
                                                <p>(iii) honoring the SpaceGrime DEX System, Collectibles, NFTs and GRIMEX in different respects or to a different extent on both chains; or</p>
                                                <p>(iv) any other response or policy or procedure, as determined by SpaceGrime in its sole and absolute discretion. SpaceGrime reserves the right to only allow one NFT to be associated with the relevant metadata forming the Collectible, notwithstanding that copies of such NFT  may exist on both chains following a fork. A User assumes full responsibility to independently remain apprised of and informed about possible forks, and to manage a User own interests in connection therewith.</p>
                                                <h7>(h) Essential Third-Party Software Dependencies.</h7>
                                                <p>The SpaceGrime DEX System and other smart contracts deployed to Binance Smart Chain are public software utilities which are accessible directly through any Binance Smart Chain node (such as Infura) or indirectly through any compatible Binance Smart Chain “wallet” application (such as the web browser plugin Metamask) which interacts with such a node. Interacting with the SpaceGrime DEX System does not require use of the SpaceGrime Apps, but the SpaceGrime Apps provide a convenient and user friendly method of reading and displaying data (including Collectible Metadata) from the SpaceGrime DEX System and generating standard transaction messages compatible with the SpaceGrime DEX System Because the SpaceGrime Platform does not provide Binance Smart Chain wallet software or Binance Smart Chain nodes, such software constitutes an essential third-party or user dependency without which the SpaceGrime Platform cannot be utilized and NFTs, Collectibles, GRIMEX and other relevant digital assets cannot be traded or used. Furthermore, Collectible Descriptors defining the art and text associated with a Collectible must be stored off of Binance Smart Chain. Collectibles created on SpaceGrime have their Collectible Descriptors stored on the IPFS system through an IPFS node operated by SpaceGrime, but SpaceGrime cannot guarantee continued operation of such IPFS node or the integrity and persistence of data on IPFS.</p>

                                                <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of certain liabilities and damages. Accordingly, some of the disclaimers and limitations set forth in these Terms may not apply in full to specific Users. The disclaimers and limitations of liability provided in these terms shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.</p>

                                                <p>All provisions of these Terms which disclaim or limit obligations or liabilities of SpaceGrime shall also apply, mutatis mutandis, to the officers, directors, members, employees, independent contractors, agents, stockholders, debtholders and affiliates of SpaceGrime.</p>
                                            <h6>9.11 Indemnification.</h6>
                                                <p>Each User shall defend, indemnify, compensate, reimburse and hold harmless SpaceGrime (and each of its officers, directors, members, employees, agents and affiliates) from any claim, demand, action, damage, loss, cost or expense, including without limitation reasonable attorneys’ fees, arising out or relating to</p>
                                                <p>(a) User’s use of, or conduct in connection with, the Offerings;</p>
                                                <p>(b) User’s violation of these Terms or any other applicable policy or contract of SpaceGrime; or </p>
                                                <p>(c) your violation of any rights of any other person or entity. </p>

                                            <h6>10.1 Governing law.</h6>
                                            <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the state of Delaware irrespective of the choice of laws principles of the state of Delaware, as to all matters, including matters of validity, construction, effect, enforceability, performance and remedies. Although the Offerings may be available in other jurisdictions, each User hereby acknowledges and agrees that such availability shall not be deemed to give rise to general or specific personal jurisdiction over SpaceGrime in any forum outside the State of Delaware.</p>
                                            <h6>10.2 Settlement Negotiations.</h6>
                                            <p>If a User has a potential legal dispute, claim or cause of action against SpaceGrime, the User shall first (prior to initiating any litigation proceedings) contact SpaceGrime by sending an email to management@spacegrime.com describing the nature of the potential dispute, claim or cause of action and providing all relevant documentation and evidence thereof. If so elected by SpaceGrime, User shall use commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate a settlement of any such legal dispute, claim or cause of action within 60 days of the delivery of such email. Any such dispute, claim or 16 cause of action that is not finally resolved by a binding, written settlement agreement within such 60 days shall be brought and resolved exclusively in accordance with the following provisions of this Section 10.</p>
                                            <h6>10.3 Agreement to Binding, Exclusive Arbitration.</h6>
                                                <h7>(a) Mandatory Binding Arbitration.</h7>
                                                <p>Except as set forth in Section 10.2, all claims, disputes and controversies directly or indirectly arising out of or in connection with or directly or indirectly relating to these Terms or any of the matters or transactions contemplated by these Terms (for the avoidance of doubt, including any claim seeking to invalidate, or alleging that, all or any part of these Terms is unenforceable, void or voidable) (such claims, disputes and controversies, collectively, “Disputes”) shall be finally settled by binding arbitration, rather than in court. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court, agency or other governmental authority, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all Disputes.</p>
                                                <h7>(b) Waiver of Jury Trial.</h7>
                                                <p>The parties hereby acknowledge, represent and warrant that they understand that:</p>
                                                <p>(i) there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and, absent this mandatory provision, the parties would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial concerning Disputes;</p>
                                                <p>(ii) in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation;</p>
                                                <p>(iii) the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court; and</p>
                                                <p>(iv) court review of an arbitration award is limited. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to these Terms. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives any and all right to trial by jury in any action, suit or other legal proceeding arising out of or related to these Terms or the transactions contemplated hereby. </p>
                                            <h6>10.4 Arbitration Procedures.</h6>
                                            <p>SpaceGrime or any User may initiate an arbitration proceeding by delivering written notice to the other, whereupon the parties shall reasonably cooperate to select an arbitrator and submit the relevant Dispute to such arbitrator. In the event the parties are unable to agree on the selection of an arbitrator within 15 days from the filing of a demand for arbitration, the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) shall appoint the arbitrator. Any such arbitration shall be administered by the AAA in accordance with the provisions of its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the supplementary procedures for consumer related disputes of the AAA excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions. SpaceGrime will not seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator’s award shall be written and reasoned, and binding on the parties, and may be entered by any party as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
                                            <h6>10.5 Seat of Arbitration.</h6>
                                            <p>The seat of arbitration shall be Wilmington, Delaware. The arbitrator may choose to have the arbitration of any Dispute conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or at a mutually agreed location; provided, however, that SpaceGrime may opt to transfer the venue of any arbitration hearing to Wilmington, Delaware in the event that it agrees to pay any additional fees or costs a User may reasonably incur as a result of the change in venue, as determined by the arbitrator, and, subject to the foregoing, a User hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in Wilmington, Delaware, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p>
                                            <h6>10.6 Confidentiality of Arbitration.</h6>
                                            <p>Except to the extent necessary to enforce their respective rights under these Terms or as otherwise required by applicable law, the parties undertake to maintain confidentiality as to the existence and events of the arbitration proceedings and as to all submissions, correspondence and evidence relating to the arbitration proceedings. This provision shall survive the termination of the arbitral proceedings.</p>
                                            <h6>10.7 Class Action Waiver.</h6>
                                                <h7>(a) No Class Actions Permitted.</h7>

USERS SHALL BRING CLAIMS AGAINST SpaceGrime OTHER ONLY IN THEIR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</p>
                                                <h7>(b) Agreements if Class Action Waiver Unenforceable.</h7>
                                                <p>If any court or arbitrator makes a final, binding and non-appealable determination that the class action waiver set forth in this Section 10.7 is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void with respect to any Dispute that would thus be required to be resolved by arbitration on a class basis, and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate such Dispute. In the event that, as a result of the application of the immediately preceding sentence or otherwise, any Dispute is not subject to arbitration, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of and venue in the federal and state courts located in Wilmington, Delaware and to accept service of process by mail with respect to such Dispute, and hereby waive any and all jurisdictional and venue defenses otherwise available with respect to such Dispute.</p>
